# A3-Self-watering-plant-
# 14270300 Self Watering Plant 

The Automated self watering plant using a MicroBit, monitors the moisture levels of the plant using a soil moisture sensor which pumps water into the plant if the soil is dry for 3 seconds. The Microbit is code so that it automatically checks the soil's moisture every few minutes. The MicroBit displays the moisture levels on its LED screen at all times and has two buttons one to show the exact soil moisture and the other to pump water manually for 3 seconds.

## General Information
- What problem does it (intend to) solve? 
The automated self-watering plant is trying to fix the issue of people over watering their plants or leaving them dehydrated, by using this project it automatically water's the plant according to it's needs. 

- What is the purpose of your project? 
To make a self-watering Plant so that i wouldn't need to worry about my plant drying out and dying. 

- Why did you undertake it? 
I thought the project seemed interesting and it would allow me to deepen my knowledge in coding. 



## Technologies Used
- MakeCode 
- Micro-Bit - Version 1.0 - Had to update it so it would connected
- Water pump - 3 Volts
- Relay module



## Features
- Awesome feature 1 - When you press button A on the MicroBit it pumps water into the plant for 3 seconds 
- Awesome feature 2 - When you press button B on the MicroBit it tells you the Moisure levels of the plant
- Awesome feature 3 - Smiley face when turned on 
- Awesome feature 4 - Soil moisture levels shown at all times

## Setup
You needed these resources to created the project: a Plant, a MicroBit, Electronic Soil Moisture Sensor, Water pump 3 volts, Relay Module, Crocodile cable's, container and cable wires. The project needs a large amount of area to set it up. To get started you will need to set up the wires to the microbit, soil moisture sensor, relay module and water pump. I was inspired by a tutorial for the setup (shown in the acknowledgements). Then you download the code onto the Microbit, then you can start it. 




## Usage

When pressing button A on the Micro-bit it starts the pump for 3 seconds putting water into the plant.

When pressing button B the Micro-bit reads the moisture level of the plant and puts it on the screen.

## Project Status
Project is: _in progress_ 

The projected doesn't fully work, only when you press button A does the pump put water into the plant, it won't do it on its own. The code needs to be fixed. 


## Room for Improvement

Room for improvement:
- Have it work by itself. Only when you press button B does it put water into the plant. 
- Make the cables more organised/ Hidden.  

To do:
- Figure out/research what is going wrong with the code so that it will work.
- Adding a little container that can store the cables will make it look neater, putting the Microbit on this container so it is on full display. 


## Acknowledgements
- This project was inspired by my dehydrated plants. 
- This project was based on [this tutorial](https://www.instructables.com/Automatic-Plant-Watering-System-Using-a-Microbit/).
- Many thanks to Andrew stapleton for letting me borrow his Mircobit and crocodile cables.
